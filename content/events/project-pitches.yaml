    We will received Project Pitches from you, and are super excited to hear you tell us about it. 
    In this event, you'll present your idea to all techies, in a short, 2-3 minutes presentation 
    (there are a lot of decks, so please be mindful of your presentation time!).

    You will all have the change to make questions and later select your favorite 3 projects. We'll then assign the teams and get it all started!
