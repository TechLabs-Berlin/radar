    We want to invite you for a round of digital socialising. We will provide some input
    on habit building and we will share an outlook of the semester. You will be able to
    share your initial experiences with your track: what's your first impression?
    Do you like the topic? What are you struggling with?

    Our Agenda:

    1. How to build habits & learn (Sarah)
    1. Icebreaking Session (Brando)
    1. Semester Outlook (Sarah)
    1. Break-Out Session per Track
