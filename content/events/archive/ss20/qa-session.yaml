    We're sure you'll have a lot of questions about TechLabs. Please take the time to watch our Info Session.
    If you have additional questions after watching our info session, ask us anything using the question form.

    We will host a Q&A session on Google Meet on **Tuesday, 14/04/2020 at 8pm** where we'll answer all your questions.
    Please do not hesitate to ask any question you have.

    To participate in the Q&A session, all you need is a web browser. You should bring a working microphone and
    (if you want) a webcam, too.
