    In our Final Event we will revisit your TechLabs journey this semester, present your
    project work and celebrate your collaborative learning effort together!

    After a short introduction, each group has the chance to present their elevator pitch (i.e. the videos) to their
    fellow participants. Afterwards we'll have a short feedback round as well as a Q&A. Please make sure that at least
    one member of your team is available to present your project and answer questions. Each group will have around
    10 mins to present and talk about their projects. We created the following timetable for the event:

    - 19:00 Welcoming
    - 19:10 SOKR
    - 19:20 Berlin Historical Tours
    - 19:30 BerlinRents.Live
    - 19:40 Berliving
    - 19:50 Transafety
