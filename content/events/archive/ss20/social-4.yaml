    After we've wrapped up the TechLabs Berlin Summer Semester, we want to take the opportunity to finally
    meet as many of you as possible. We will meet in [Monbijou Park in Mitte](https://goo.gl/maps/j4RVsh1JZPkcYekZ9)
    and celebrate all the effort, hard work and new learnings of your TechLabs journey.

    We'll bring some beer, but please feel encouraged to also take your favorite food or beverage with you for
    a nice evening.

    In case of bad weather our back-up slot is one day before on **Saturday, July 25th at 7pm**. We'll let you know
    about the final date as soon as we can (it will be on Sunday if there's no giant thunderstorm).
