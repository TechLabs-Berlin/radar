    We want to invite you for a round of digital socialising.

    Because we want to encourage you to not only talk about your own success/failure stories but also to benefit from
    what your fellow participants have already learned, we will set up different breakout rooms where you can meet to
    discuss specific topics together.

    After a short introduction you'll be able to decide whether you want to join
    a breakout session about **How to connect DS Backend with HTML, CSS, JS Frontend (Flask)** hosted by Bogdan or to
    take part in a **SQL crash course** with Anna (of course its also able to switch between the two sessions).
