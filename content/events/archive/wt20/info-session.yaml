  We're sure you'll have a lot of questions about TechLabs.

  On **September 13th at 8pm**, we will host an Info Session where we'll talk about TechLabs, the tracks we offer, and details about the upcoming semester.
  Our goal is for everybody to have a clear understanding about TechLabs Berlin.

  To participate in the Q&A session, all you need is a web browser. You should bring a working microphone and
  (if you want) a webcam, too.
