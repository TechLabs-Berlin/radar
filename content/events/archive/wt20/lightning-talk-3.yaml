    **Maximilian Jenders** is a Data Scientist at **GetYourGuide**. GetYourGuide is an online marketplace for tourist activities and was among the three most innovative travel companies in 2019. Max has been doing Data Science since 2012 and has extensive experience in academia and the industry.

    He will share his experience with typical data science challenges in GetYourGuide, such as “How much should we pay for advertisements” and “What kind of products should we recommend to our users.” He will also cover how to approach data science challenges in general, what data pipelines are, and how to use them.

    While this talk focuses on data science and AI, we can also recommend it to web development and UX techies. The presentation does not dive too much into technical details, and it is an excellent opportunity to learn how your ds/ai team members are working and approaching challenges.
