  Every team will have the oppurtunity to present their current status in a short presentation. We would like to see **what have you been up to these past 4 weeks**:

  * From pitch to plan
  * Decisions, explorations, roadblocks, learnings
  * Current stage & plan for the final stretch
  * Anything to show?
