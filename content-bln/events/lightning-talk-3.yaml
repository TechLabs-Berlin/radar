  [Vitor Alencar](https://www.instagram.com/vitormalencar/) is a senior software engineer who loves to share knowledge, give talks and help other developers. Throughout his career as a programmer, he had the opportunity to work with large companies and was able to help improve the educational system in Brazil, allowing parents and schools to communicate in real-time. Heâ€™s helped over 10 million people share their opinions online, and today at Taxfix he helps thousands of people to control their lives using their money intelligently.

  In this talk, he will share part of his story: how he became a developer and left a small town in the countryside to pursue his international career.
