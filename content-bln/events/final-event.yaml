  In our Final Event we will revisit your TechLabs journey this semester, present your
  project work and celebrate your collaborative learning effort together!

  After a short introduction, each group has the chance to present their elevator pitch to their
  fellow participants. Afterwards we'll have a short feedback round as well as a Q&A.

  To wrap it up we will have a open network session where you can celebrate together your great work!
