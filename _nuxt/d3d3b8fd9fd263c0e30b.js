If you\'re familiar with the material covered in our Data Science\\ntrack you can pursue to do the AI track. But please keep in mind that you should have a solid foundation; it\'s not advisable to take the\\nAI track if you \\"started some online course\\" on Data Science in the past or know only about some of the topics.\\n"},{"title":"Would it be better to choose Data Science or AI to learn more about Python?","content":"If you don\'t have experience using Python or another language commonly used with AI algorithms, we recommend\\nyou to do the Data Science track first and attend the Artificial Intelligence track in the next semester.\\nIt is very difficult to learn programming basics in conjunction with AI methods at the same time.\\n"},{"title":"Do we have to decide between R and Python with the Data Science track?","content":"Yes, you will choose either R or Python as your programming language for the Data Science track. Learning both\\nin one TechLabs semester is not very useful because you would need to learn the basic language concepts for both\\nlanguages and could spend less time actually working on data.\\n\\nThat being said, it will be much easier for you to dive into the other language once you\'ve mastered the most\\ncommon Data Science tasks (input preparation & cleaning, data analytics, machine learning) in one language.\\n"},{"title":"For a person with no previous tech skills, would you recommend the Data Science or Web Development track?","content":"It\'s not really related to the technology but it depends on what you want to do with your acquired skills.\\nIf you\'re more of a \\"numbers person\\" who wants to work with data and learn how to draw data-oriented conclusions,\\nyou should think about taking the Data Science track. If you want to build a product (a website, an app) you would\\nmore likely choose the Web Development track.\\n"},{"title":"Which experience level is suitable for the User Experience Design track?","content":"The UX track is personalized – like all our other tracks. Depending on your previous knowledge you will be\\ngiven lessons which require mor or less previous experience with user research and prototyping methods.\\n"}]},{"title":"TechLabs Academy","questions":[{"title":"Do the courses have weekly assignments or can I work at my own pace?","content":"We don\'t have weekly assignments like typical university classes. But it makes a lot of sense to allocate\\na weekly amount of time that you\'re willing to spend on working for TechLabs. We also run some competitions\\nwhich are designated to motivate you to stay on-track. You can choose to complete everything in one week,\\nbut that would not make much sense because TechLabs is all about making some progress every week and talking\\nto other people about that.\\n"},{"title":"Is there any coach/trainer who we can contact for help?","content":"Yes, there are. We call them mentors and they\'re specialized on the tracks you\'re going to choose. They will\\nhelp you to keep motivated and to stay on track. If you have any specific question about your learning material,\\nyou will also be able to ask your mentor, of course. They will also coach you in the project phase – they\'ve\\nalready worked in some projects in your designated field and can share their expertise.\\n"},{"title":"Are there only online videos or also video lessons or chats once a week?","content":"We will organize a variety of events during the semester:\\n\\n- We will regularly meet up for important milestones.\\n- There will be social events for getting to know each other better.\\n- Industry experts will contribute some talks about broader tech topics, such as productivity, habit hacking,\\n  user research, design thinking etc.\\n\\nWe will facilitate your engagement in the community, but we rely on your motivation for it to be successful.\\nThe meetings will take place remotely as long as the COVID-19 situation persists. If circumstances allow, we\\nwill switch to in-person meetings during this semester, or for the next one.\\n"},{"title":"Are any resources or materials required to participate?","content":"This depends on your track choice, but the material for all tracks is either free, or it costs an insignificant\\namount of money. We don\'t want to lose anyone just because they can\'t afford to pay for online learning resources.\\n\\nApart from publicly-accessible resources, the following learning providers are used:\\n- Data Science: DataCamp – free for students, otherwise 29$ per month\\n- Artificial Intelligence: free\\n- Web Development: Udemy – 10-15€\\n- UX Design: Udemy – 10-15€\\n"},{"title":"Are there any fees associated with any of the courses?","content":"No, TechLabs provides everything for you free-of-charge. Depending on your track there may be some cost for\\nonline learning resources (see above), but they are not significant.\\n"},{"title":"Are the tracks only on educated, or are there also other online courses?","content":"The track content is provided on edyoucated, which will link to other platforms depending on your track.\\nMoreover, we will host video conferences for talks which are not focused on one particular track, but on\\nlarger technology-related areas, such as Time Management, Habit Building and User Research.\\n"},{"title":"What does Track Personalization mean?","content":"Track Personalization means that we tailor your learning experience to your interests and previous knowledge.\\nFor example, if you don\'t have any previous data science background, we\'ll help you to learn the statistical\\nbackgrounds in addition to the Python/R coding exercises. This allows you to start learning right where you\\nwill benefit from the most.\\n"},{"title":"Is there a certificate at the end of the course?","content":"Yes, if you finish the course successfully, you will get the TechLabs Digital Shaper Certificate.\\n\\nSuccessfully completed means that:\\n\\n- You\'ve completed your personalized learning track\\n- You\'ve participated in and submitted your project\\n- You wrote a summary of your project\'s use case including problem and solution statements to make your work visible\\n\\nDon\'t worry, we will assist you with each of those tasks.\\n"},{"title":"How many working hours should I spend per week?","content":"You should be able to reserve about 5 to 10 hours of continuous working time per week for TechLabs. The amount\\nof time needed depends on the semester phase. There will be weeks in which you will spend less time and some where\\nyou are encouraged to work more, for example before submitting your project.\\n"},{"title":"Can I work on more than one track?","content":"As our goal is to facilitate collaboration among our participants, taking more than one course or project\\nat a time does not make much sense. You are of course free to learn other topics besides your TechLabs tracks\\nand to contribute everything you know to your project.\\n"}]},{"title":"Projects","questions":[{"title":"How big are the teams in the final team projects?","content":"This depends on the type and scope of your project. If you choose to work on a problem that encompasses multiple\\nproblem domains (such as building a web application for data visualization), you will need to work together with\\nmore participants, potentially.\\n\\nUsusally project groups consist of three to five people.\\n"},{"title":"How are the teams chosen?","content":"You will choose your team on the basis of the project you\'re interested in working on. You\'ll vote on the project,\\nwe\'ll help you build the team.\\n"},{"title":"Do I need to develop my own project idea?","content":"Your projects should ideally solve a real-world problem. Therefore, project templates which we create do not\\nseem very worthwhile towards this goal and also your personal motivation for working on the project.\\n\\nThat being said, we will host workshops for project ideation, user research, and to define your problem and\\nsolution fields. You won\'t be left alone and everyone will be able to work on a meaningful project idea\\nfrom the community.\\n"}]},{"title":"Application","questions":[{"title":"Will you offer another TechLabs semester this winter?","content":"Although there is no fixed schedule yet, we definitely plan on doing so. Please\\n[subscribe to our newsletter](https://bln.techlabs.org/newsletter) or follow us on social media (linked in the\\nheader) to stay updated.\\n"},{"title":"How are you going to select the students?","content":"We aspire to enable our participants to use the skills they\'ve acquired in one of our courses to have a\\nreal world impact. This is the main goal of our program and the main criteria for our evaluation. You should\\nshow that you\'re willing and able to take the time to complete the course successfully. And you should provide\\na clear vision of what you think you would be able to accomplish with digital skills learned in the course.\\n"},{"title":"How are the chances to get in?
